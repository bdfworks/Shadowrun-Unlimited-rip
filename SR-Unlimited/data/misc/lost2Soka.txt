Defeat.

You wish you had died. Soka applied a slap patch and a pair of handcuffs to keep you alive and contained on the way back to Renraku. There they rip your mind. Conversion to a cyber zombie soon follows and your personal destruction of all your allies. Eventually, you are sent to retrieve the box from the place where it was entombed and hand the cursed thing to Soka.
